this is a chatGPT based simple interactive bot. which gives you simple reply based on your text.
it can also perform simple task including calculations.

i have fetched OpenAI along with discord.js to create this bot.
it got a name also "Bubble".

How to run:- find the "TOKEN" from discord.js website of your bot and paste token in index, and command file
in place of previous tokens, as it gets update everytime so we need to change the token.

run "npm start" command.

ENJOY!
